# Cam-Profile-Synthesis-and-Follower-Motion-Visualization
A Python project that simulates cam-follower systems using polynomial, cycloidal, and sinusoidal motion laws. It models full cam cycles (rise, dwell, return), computes displacement, velocity, and acceleration, and visualizes the follower motion with clear plots and smooth animations.
