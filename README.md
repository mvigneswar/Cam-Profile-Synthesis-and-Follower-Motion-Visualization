This project simulates and visualizes cam-follower mechanisms using standard motion laws—polynomial, cycloidal, and sinusoidal—commonly applied in mechanical design. It generates complete cam profiles with rise, dwell, and return phases, calculates displacement, velocity, and acceleration, and animates the motion of a flat-faced follower over a full 360° cam rotation.

Key Features:
Support for multiple motion laws with modular implementation
Kinematic plots for displacement, velocity, and acceleration
Flat-faced follower simulation with real-time animation
Phase-wise synthesis: rise, dwell, fall, and second dwell
Clean, extensible codebase suitable for educational and design use

Built With:
NumPy for numerical operations
Matplotlib for plotting and animation
